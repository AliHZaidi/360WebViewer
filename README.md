# 360WebViewer
This project utilizes open source libraries to create a more immersive web
experience. The ultimate goal is to create a browser add-on that detects 360
degree content in web browsers and prompts the user to input using webcam gaze
tracking.

# How to Set up
This project requires two libraries to be placed in a folder in the root
directory titled "libs".
* Clone [this repo] (https://github.com/jsimonson2013/360WebViewer.git).
* Create a folder titled "libs" in the root directory.
* Go to [brown's webgazer library] (https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/#download).
* Click the Download WebGazer.js button and save it (Ctrl + s) as "webgazer.js"
in the libs folder from step 2.
* Go to [mozilla's vr library] (https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/introduction/getting-started.html#include-the-js-build).
